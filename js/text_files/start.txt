Welcome to ScriptUNC!
In this game, you will learn how to program using Javascript!
To help you get started, here are a few controls:
- Click anywhere on screen to move to that position.
- Click and drag anywhere to have control of the camera.
- Click on the mini map in the top left corner to recenter the screen on Rameses!

Try exploring the map for a bit, and to continue, click on the prompt:
"scriptUNC.console ~ >" in the top left corner of the console.
